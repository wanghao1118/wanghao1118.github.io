<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a master's student from Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University who is about to graduate. I'm supervised by Prof. Meixiu Sun and Associate Prof. Hongxiao Li from Institution of Biomedical Engineering,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College.

From Apr. 2024 to Jul. 2024, I worked at JD.com as a daily intern at Beijing, undertaken construction of retrieval augment generation (RAG) frame and fine-tuning of embedding model.

In my first two years before I join in JD.com, I dedicated to develop early lung cancer screening model with breath analysis and radiomics and explore minimizing sceeening device based breath analysis with few features prediction model.

My research interest includes unified medical multi-modal large language models (MLLM), MLLM hallucination and optimization of vision encoder. Currenlty, I am deeply involved in radiology report generation with MLLM.
